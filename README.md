# Stock_Analysis
Steve's parents stock


Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to learn how to work with mass amounts of data and create Macros to give us multiple steps of analyzing this data with the click of a button. We gave Steve's parents a look at not only the one stock they were particularly interested in but also compared it to 11 other stocks with data from two seperate years of activity for each stock. 

Results
The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
Summary


There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general (3 pt).
There are clear advantages to refactoring data such as minimizing run time and getting a result quicker but also cutting down the amount of code the computer has to delegate through. It also minimizes memory space and prevents any lags due to memory space. It also gives a more compact version to completing it for the other people that want to read the macros you built. The disadvantage is the same situation to compacting it- it may be difficult to follow along with the code if you have an error and to easily pin point where that error is coming from, versus having everything singled out. 


Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script 


The advantages to the original script is that it was more detailed and easier to follow along to someone that is not familiar with writing code or reading it. The main advantage to the refactored VBA script is that its quicker, takes less memory, and more compact.
